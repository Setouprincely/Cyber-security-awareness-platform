# WebSocket Connection Fix

## Problem
The application was trying to connect to a WebSocket server on port 3001 that wasn't running, causing the login to hang with infinite retry attempts.

## Solution Applied
1. **Disabled WebSocket by default**: Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_ENABLED=false` to `.env.local`
2. **Limited retry attempts**: Modified WebSocketProvider to stop retrying after 3 failed attempts
3. **Made WebSocket optional**: The app now works without WebSocket connection

## Current Status
- ✅ Login should now work properly without hanging
- ✅ Application functions normally without real-time features
- ✅ WebSocket errors are limited and won't cause infinite loops

## To Enable Real-time Features (Optional)

If you want to enable real-time notifications and updates:

### Option 1: Use the provided WebSocket server
1. Install the `ws` package:
   ```bash
   npm install ws @types/ws
   ```

2. Start the WebSocket server:
   ```bash
   npm run ws:server
   ```

3. Enable WebSocket in your `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_ENABLED=true
   ```

4. Restart your Next.js application

### Option 2: Use your own WebSocket server
1. Set up your own WebSocket server on port 3001
2. Enable WebSocket in `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_ENABLED=true
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://your-websocket-server:port
   ```

## Files Modified
- `src/components/providers/WebSocketProvider.tsx` - Added retry limits and optional connection
- `.env.local` - Added WebSocket configuration
- `src/lib/websocket-server.js` - Created optional WebSocket server
- `package.json` - Added WebSocket server script

## Testing
1. Try logging in - it should work without hanging
2. Check browser console - WebSocket errors should be limited
3. Application should function normally without real-time features
